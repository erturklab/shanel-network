# SHANEL Prediction & Cell Counting

This repository contains the code for [Cell/bioarXiv-link to SHANEL paper].

## Overview

In this repository you will find the ressources to perform all deep learning and image analysis tasks described in the [SHANEL paper], including training a convolutional neural network, predicting a binary mask on tissue-cleared images and counting cells on binary masks.

## Requirements
Python 3.6
[List all used packages  - numpy, scipy, torch, torchvision, multiprocessing, fast-cca, nibabel, etc.]

## Cell Counting

- get binary mask as .nii (or .nii.gz) file, select amount of processors, run
TODO Olivers code!

## Predcition

TODO TODO TODO

## Training

- Show some tensorboard pics
- How to access tensorboard
- Which gpu to use
